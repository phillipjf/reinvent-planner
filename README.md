## NOTE: UPDATE 2019

The tool has been updated for 2019 but it seems like AWS has not yet disclosed the location of each session, so those will show up as `null` in your schedule for the moment until they start publishing that information again.

## Run it locally

### Requirements

- Node v10.16.3 or higher

### Steps

- Clone this repository
- Install node dependencies

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```

- Start development server

  ```sh
  $ npm start
  ```

The app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000
